# hello-world
Philosofool's first repository on GitHub. I'm learning.

I taught logic, decision theory and philosophy of science at a large regional public university for 10 years. After a COVID-19 layoff, I'm learning to translate a lot of self-taught programming skills into something more robust.

What do I know? Some python. A tiny bit of Unity. I learned TeX to write a disseration. I have a lot of non-computing background in logic and scientific method.
